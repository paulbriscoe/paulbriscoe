- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @paulbriscoe from Toronto, Canada. Old white guy, don't act my age. 
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in lots of things - particularly related to amateur radio applications
- ðŸŒ± I'm a terrible C programmer, thankfully I don't have to make a living at it. Still, I try. 
- Eventually I'll start using github for projects
- ðŸ“« You can reach me at ve3gpb@gmail.com
